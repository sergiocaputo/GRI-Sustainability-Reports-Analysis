Socio-political risks given by the presence of the Orsero Group in emerging 
countries       
The Orsero Group operates on a global basis and, in particular, between Central 
America, South America and the Mediterranean. The activities of the Orsero 
Group are therefore partly linked to non-European countries, especially regard-
ing relations with suppliers of some products. The strategy of the Orsero Group is 
mainly aimed at politically stable countries, with a fairly limited exposure. Never-
theless, all growth opportunities are carefully assessed, also through agreements 
and alliances.
