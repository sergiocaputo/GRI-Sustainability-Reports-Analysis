divided into 169 targets. The SDGs are regarded as the continuation of the millennium development goals, 
already defined in 2000 by the United Nations.  
An in-depth study was carried out in 2018 to understand the exact goals which Hera contributes most to 
through its own activities. This detailed study required the analysis of all 169 targets. The Group activities, 
projects or  policies that currently  contribute  to their  achievement were  identified.  Contribution was 
classified as high, medium or low. Goals were considered to be relevant only if one target which Hera 
contributes to had a medium or high level. The analysis confirmed the 10 goals already mapped in 2017, 
and target 17 was added. 
The SDGs which Hera contributes to are included in the CSV impact and driver areas; only goal 17 was 
regarded as cutting across the three shared value drivers. 
This analysis was used to examine in greater detail the 52 goals for the future (What we will do...) defined 
by the Hera Group for forthcoming years, reported extensively in the Appendix and summarised in the 
table at the end of this paragraph. Each (cid:862)What we will do...(cid:863) corresponds either to one of the three CSV 
drivers or to the organisational bases/levers.  
As reported in the table below, Hera’s contribution by number of (cid:862)What we will do...(cid:863) (considering the 
SDGs affected by 10 or more targets) is predominant in 6 goals: Decent work and economic growth; 
Sustainable cities and communities; Accountable consumption and production; Companies, innovation and 
infrastructure; Clean and accessible energy; Combating climate change.

The balanced scorecard of the Hera Group 
The balanced scorecard approach enables us to assign (cid:862)balanced(cid:863) objectives to our management team, 
distributed over four areas: development, quality and corporate social responsibility, organisational 
integration and efficiency upgrading.
