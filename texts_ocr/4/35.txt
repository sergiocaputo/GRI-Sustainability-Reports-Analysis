2.1 Expanding the network of destinations

This past decade has been marked by an increase in passenger traffic at Bologna
Airport, which remains consistently higher than the average in Italy. 2019 confirmed
this trend, with Bologna Airport recording an increase of 10.6% against a national
average of 2.8% in 2018. CONNECT
The air transport market is facing some significant changes and challenges, including: increased demand,
strong competition in both the airport market and between different means of transport (high speed, ground
travel connections, buses), new technology, greater awareness of environmental issues, an evolving
customer base, and changes to tourism policies. AdB intends to continue to play a primary role in the
evolving market, and to tackle its constant changes, and, as such, hopes to better adapt its business
strategy to new trends and to make the most of the resulting opportunities. The Group’s desire to expand its
network must also be viewed within the broader context of its daily commitment to sustainable development
and protecting the environment. The Group also needs to satisfy growing demand caused by increased
mobility among the local population, the industrial sector, and the growth in incoming traffic.

Within this context, AdB is working to increase its long-haul intercontinental connectivity through direct flights
and feeder services at intercontinental hubs, with a particular focus on strategic markets such as the United
States, China and the Persian Gulf. At the same time, the Group is committed to expanding its network by
offering new routes and increasing its frequency and capacity on existing routes. It also hopes to reduce
traffic seasonality and promote flights during the winter season. In addition, the company is aiming to
undertake actions to move new flights to (less congested) timeslots that help optimise airport facilities.

The Group is also committed to promoting environmental sustainability by reducing the environmental impact
of its aircraft through partnerships with its stakeholders and the local authorities.
