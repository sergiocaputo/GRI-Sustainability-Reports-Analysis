TIM, in the supplier qualification phase, in accordance with the Anti-
Corruption Policy, provides for the adoption of due diligence questionnaires
and the application of the conflict of interest procedure. In addition, in
accordance with the Group’s environmental policy, which provides general
guidelines for responsible and sustainable protection of the environment, the
company also selects its suppliers and partners and purchased or outsourced
products on the basis of environmental sustainability criteria and assesses
products and services taking into account their whole life cycle, periodically
checking compliance with the above criteria along the entire life cycle. The
company identifies and assesses environmental risks generally present at the
various levels of its supply chain and, in close collaboration with its direct
suppliers and also through partnerships at national and international level,
adopts appropriate corrective actions and improvement plans to reduce the
environmental impact of purchased products and services and their
production processes. Periodic spot checks are also made on Risk linked to the
selection and purchase orders to ascertain whether there are purchases of
goods for resale and production that do not comply with the provisions of the
conflict minerals regulation.

Finally, Ethics and Social Sustainability checks are carried out in order to
assess both suppliers' adherence to schemes and principles of ethical
business conduct and the adoption of procedures to ensure the health, safety
and rights of workers, compared with the principles underlying the Global
Compact and using international parameters referring to the SA 8000 and
SO 14001 standards.

All contracts and purchase orders include provisions for suppliers to observe
he Group's Code of Ethics and the Global Compact's principles, such as
respect for labor and human rights, environmental protection, the anti-
corruption fight, and child and forced labor. These commitments are also
included in the declarations that all suppliers sign as part of the onboarding
process. Key suppliers are evaluated on aspects such as ethics, child and
forced labor, health and safety in the workplace, freedom of association and
rights to collective bargaining, discrimination, harassment, diversity and
management of the environmental impact.
